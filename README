Lightbox
========

This is a rails plugin based off the Multifaceted Lightbox @ http://www.gregphoto.net/lightbox/. The syntax for the plugin was copied from Redbox @ http://blog.craigambrose.com/articles/2006/08/16/redbox-a-rails-compatible-lightbox because of its ease of use. The reason for the plugins creation was after testing it can handle flash content in FF 2.0 Mac without any weird overlay bugs.

To use:

This loads the javascript and css needed for lightbox plugin.

Insert between <head></head>: <%= load_lightbox %>

Please refer to rails_lightbox_helper for possible usage or goto redbox website to see commands to use. The equivalent for lightbox is the redbox function renamed with lightbox.
